# Advent of SQL

Just like in your lovely chocolately advent calendar, this Christmas you get a SQL-y advent calendar.

But instead of chocolate behind the doors, you get Christmas themed SQL challenges.

From 1st December until Christmas eve you'll get a daily challenge emailed to you to sharpen your SQL skills.

Each day a new advent door will swing open. Inside you'll have a Christmas themed challenge, and a DB dump with all the data you'll need to complete the challenge (and instructions on how to use it).
